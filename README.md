# skipping_upto_boston


Hello !!!! Welcome to my project. 

Skipping Upto Boston is my take on the Boston AirBnB dataset in conjunction with the Seattle dataset, where I intend to
make some meaningful discoveries into the secret lives of "home" listers

Description : 
The jupyter notebook looks at the Boston and Seattle listings,reviews and calendar datasets and tries to answer 4 questions

1. Does the listing pricing vary across cities and neighbourhoods within a city ?
2. What kind of property types and room types have a high usage based on the number of reviews?
3. What kind of amenities are associated with highly reviewed and popular listings ?
4. How much influence do parameters like host response rate,host response time,host since and cancellation 

I deployed my almost ninja"ish" pandas & python skills to dig into the data and wrnagle and mangle it beyond proportions in order to answer my "burning" questions
These datasets are quite old and I hope to use a larger and more recent version to qualify my discoveries.

Just download the jupyter notebook along with the datasets and run it in your local conda environment. 
I have utilised the below packages and libraries

1.pandas
2.numpy
3.matplotlib
4.seaborn
